To run and use the program

The program has been ran using the g++ compiler, it should work with other compilers, however gcc seems not work for this project, thus we cannot gurantee the functionality for other compilers beside g++.
The command is as follows (assuming the files are the only cpp files in the working directory):
"g++ \*.cpp -o main"
The previous command complies, to run the program use “./main.{extension}” where extension will be replaced by the appropriate exteSOPToFunctionnsion per operating system:-
For windows: “./main.exe”
For linux: “./main”
For mac: “./main”

When running, you will be prompted to either pick “c”, to input a custom sop string input attempt, or pick “p” to run the predefined test cases.
In the custom input option, type your sop string in the terminal, if there are any errors in the input, the program will crash with an error of invalid input.
In the predefined input option, the program will run each test case and ask you if you wish to continue before running the next test case. To continue to the test case press enter.
